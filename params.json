{"name":"RoadRunner","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to RoadRunner.\r\nThis is an app to determine how far you should jog. For example you had burgers, fries and a soda for lunch. In your evening jog you want to make sure that youâ€™re burning calories. You insert the number of calories that you consumed and the RoadRunner app will give you a distance. You then can use maps to plan your end location. Take a victory selfie after you finish your run.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n![image](http://i.imgur.com/hPSzZWP.png)\r\n![image](http://i.imgur.com/qeKuOeP.png)\r\n![image](http://i.imgur.com/usN1wjs.png)\r\n![image](http://i.imgur.com/bjZReCU.png)\r\n![image](http://i.imgur.com/HgCZdG1.png)\r\n![image](http://i.imgur.com/hKavvtE.png)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nRahat Mahmud (@rahatmahmud)\r\nRadcliffe Saddler (@rsaddler)\r\nMichelle Nguyen (@nmisyel)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
